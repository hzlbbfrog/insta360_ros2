# insta360_ros2
This repository is a ROS 2 driver for Insta360 cameras.

## 📢 Features
I have tested on an **x86_64 (or AMD64) PC** and an **AArch64 (or ARM64)** device (Specifially, **Nvidia Jetson AGX Orin** 32GB).  
🤔 I know you guys may have problems running Insta360 cameras on AArch64 devices (me too!😩).  
No worries, I can help you! 🤝

## 🏎️ Prerequisites
### 1.1 Insta360 SDK
First of all, you need to apply an account of Insta360, and then apply for a SDK online (below).
